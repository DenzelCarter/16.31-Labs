Executive Summary: PID vs Heuristic Control Analysis
============================================================
Date: 2025-10-07 13:16:58

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:
--------------------
 Identical test trajectory: 0.5m -> 1.5m
 Same test duration: 30 seconds
 Same drone, sensors, and environmental conditions
 Fair comparison with controlled initial conditions

PERFORMANCE COMPARISON RESULTS:
-----------------------------------
PID Controller superior in: 3/6 metrics (50%)

KEY PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:
--------------------------------
 rms_error: -19.6% improvement
 steady_state_error: +73.6% improvement

TODO: Write your technical summary here
Based on the experimental results:
- Has PID outperformed if-else control?
- What are the key advantages?
- Does this provide competitive advantage?

RECOMMENDATION:
--------------
TODO: Should AeroTech proceed with PID-based proposal?
