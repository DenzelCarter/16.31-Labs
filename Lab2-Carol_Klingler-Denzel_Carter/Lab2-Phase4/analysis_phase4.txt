Deliverable 1 (Trajectory tracking data): pid_3cycle_trajectory.csv, pole_3cycle_trajectory.csv
Deliverable 2 (Performance comparison): trajectory_comparison.json
Deliverable 3 (Plots): pid_3cycle_tracking.png, pole_3cycle_tracking.png
Deliverable 4 (Executive Summary): 
    Which controller met Navy requirements more completely?
    Quantify the advantage in tracking accuracy and stability:
    Compare design time: trial-and-error tuning vs. systematic pole selection:
    Why does error accumulate more with PID over multiple cycles?
    Final recommendation: Which approach should AeroTech use for the Navy contract?
    Include plots showing:
        • 3D trajectory plots (reference vs. actual) for both controllers
        • Tracking error vs. time for 5-cycle test
        • Bar chart comparing key metrics
