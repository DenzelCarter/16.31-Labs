Deliverable 2 (Document rationale for final pole selection): We decided to stick with real poles for simplicity and to avoid having overshoot. 
    The final poles were [-0.8, -1.35, -1.2] for [x, y, z] in the tag frame. 
    Although our methodology followed the theoretical expectations, during testing we had trouble having the drone line up to expected performance. 
    Even with real poles, we would encounter overshoot which we attribute to potentially mismatches between the plant model and the real dynamics of the drone, 
    the inner control scheme of the drone potentially overriding our control if the floor is not patterned enough to differentiate, and potentially slow communications of commands 
    from the receiving of camera feed, processing of Apriltags, and to the rc commands back to the drone. If we lowered the closed loop pole for a given axis, it would usually be 
    too slow and not reach the target value but oscillations would vanish. If we moved the pole further left, as expected the response was able to quickly reach the target but 
    oscillations would ensue which may be due to measurement noise being amplified, which we did see a lot of from phase 1. The steady state error was the only metric we were able to 
    get within requirement bounds due to these issues with our experimental setup. Overshoot was not too high but making complex poles would likely make it worse. The responses were
    not too slow but no settling times were achieved.
