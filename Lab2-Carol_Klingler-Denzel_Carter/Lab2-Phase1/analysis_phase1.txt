Deliverable 2 (Identify optimal operating range): 
    Based on the pose noise vs distance alone, the optimal operating range appears to be around 1.5m away, which agrees with 
    the expectation for Tello. This is the point where all 3 axis measurement noises were simultaneously low. However, the detection reliability was below the desired 
    threshold of 95% so we will prefer to look to 2.0m away from the Apriltag, where the noise in each axis is still relatively low. Somewhere in this 1.5 to 2.0 m range appears 
    to be the optimal range based on our testing. Although being further away gives a very high detection rate, noise in the 3 axes increases quite fast so we don't want it to be 
    too far away.
