Time spent tuning: 11/07/25 - 5:50pm-6:50pm, 11/08/25 - 1:40pm-3:00pm
Difficulty achieving simultaneous requirements on all axes: 
    Aside from taking a very long time to perform trial and error for each axis individually, it was difficult to determine which responses were better between tuning 
    choices, some would be faster but oscillate worse while stable responses were too slow. There seemed to be some coupling between axes tuning that made it difficult to 
    achieve better tuning for all 3 axes, which makes sense since they all rely on the thrust vectoring of the same 4 rotors.
Trade-offs encountered (e.g., fast response vs low overshoot): 
    Higher proportional gains were faster and would actually reach the target, but would have worse overshoot and also had issues with 
    less stability (more oscillations). Steady state error seemed easy to target using integral gains but the coupling between proportional and derivative gains gave us more trouble.
