The baseline approach of a simple landing using direct sensor feedback is
succeptive to attack because of the way it purely relies on the accuracy of
the ToF sensor reading. Let's say our target altitude z_target was 0.2m, 
proportional control gain was 0.5, actual altitude was 0.1m, 
and the ToF was attacked and read 0.5m higher than truth, 
then instead of our commanded vertical velocity giving:
v_z = K_p (z_target - z_ToF) = 0.5 (0.2 - 0.1) = +0.05, it would give:
v_z = 0.5 (0.2 - 0.6) = -0.2, which if our drone was actually below the target
altitude, would cause it to rapidly go the wrong direction and actually crash
into the ground catastrophically.
