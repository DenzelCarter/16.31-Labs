1. Does the system reach and maintain the target altitude?
Yes, the system does reach the target altitude, however the oscillations amplitudes are large enough that the altitude departs from the acceptable at its peaks. 

=======================================================================

2. Is the behavior smooth or jerky?
The behavior is mostly smooth, as it is oscillating at 'low' frequencies and not very jittery or jerky.



=======================================================================

3. Is it stable or oscillatory?
It is oscillatory, and oscillates around the correct target altitude. However as stated in Q1, the oscillation amplitude is larger than the acceptable band. 



=======================================================================
4. What causes any oscillations you observe?
The oscillations occur because outside of the band, the drone is commanded a set velocity to fix it. However, this velocity is not dependent on how large the error is. This causes overshoot in the motion in the opposite direction, which again causes the drone to depart the range, and this cycles continues. 

=======================================================================
5. What are the fundamental limitations of this approach?
The biggest limitation is that any error regardless of size is treated the same (is then given the same response velocity command). This means that whether you are off 1 cm or 1m you are correcting with the same velocity. Because of momentum, oscillations can occur outside of your target range. The heuristic control velocities would have to be very small in order for the oscillation amplitudes to be within the acceptable band, but large errors would take longer to correct.
