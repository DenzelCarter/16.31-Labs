Phase 2: Sensor Calibration Analysis 
Task 2.1
• Plot commanded and actual velocity vs time (see plot)
• Plot both sonar and barometer height vs time (see plot)
• Plot measured vertical velocity vs time

It should be noted here that the measure vz does not appear to follow the commanded vz. This is likely because the fidelity of the velocity sensor, or however the velocity is calculated within the Tello drone, is not high enough for the small changes in velocity and small time scales at which these changes are occurring. This explains why the blue line in the plot is mostly flat, with only slight variations from 0 m/s. The drone itself, however, did follow the commanded velocities physically, suggesting the data gathered by the drone is not able to pick up on these small velocities. 

It should also be noted that we combined the vertical velocity and actual velocity, because the vertical velocity is the only changing velocity throughout the commanded motion. Thus one plot suffices for the vertical velocity, commanded and actual velocity plots. 

• Calculate the actual height change for each step command by comparing pre/post step heights

For step change 1 (0.2m/s): 
Starting sonar height: 0.82m 
Final sonar height: 1.11m 
Change in height: ~+0.298m

For step change 2 (-0.15m/s):
Starting sonar height: 1.14m
Final sonar height: 0.97m
Change in height: ~-0.17m

For step change 3 (0.3m/s):
Starting sonar height: 0.95m
Final sonar height: 1.41m
Change in height:~ +0.45m


For step change 4 (-0.25m/s):
Starting sonar height: 1.47m
Final sonar height: 1.19m
Change in height:~ -0.28m

As you can see, despite the recorded velocities being around 0 m/s, there are clear changes in position, suggesting that the velocities are nonzero, and that velocity measurements at this scale and timeframe do not reflect the true values. 

• Create a calibration table comparing commanded vs measured altitude changes
See step_calibration_table.csv 

• Identify which sensor (sonar or barometer) is more reliable for your altitude range
As explained in phase 1, the sonar measurement is more reliable for the altitude range. For these small changes in altitude, the sonar measurement is more accurate. Barometer measurements vary greatly and do not seem to have the resolution needed for these small changes in height. Further analysis and explanation can be found in the txt file in phase 1. 

• Calculate provided performance metrics (completed -- see code) 


Task 2.2
• For each velocity step, calculate expected vs actual height changes (see csv)
• Implement linear regression: fit actual = scale × expected + bias (see json file)
• Calculate R2 values to assess goodness of fit for both sensors (see results json file)
• Calculate RMSE (root mean square error) for both sensors (see results json file)
• Determine which sensor (sonar or barometer) provides more reliable measurements

As explained in both task 2.1 and in Phase 1 of the lab, the sonar measurements are more reliable than the barometer in these altitude scales. RMSE is the root mean square error, which is dramatically less for the sonar than the barometer measurements (0.0264  vs 0.685). Additionally, it has a higher R^2 value, at 0.99, vs 0.95 for the barometer measurement. This mean the sonar measurements have less variation than the barometer measurement. 

• Save calibration results (scale, bias, R2, RMSE) to JSON file
The data collection and plotting are provided, focus on implementing the analysis calculations
